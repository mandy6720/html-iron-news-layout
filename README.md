## HTML/CSS/Git Intro - Iron News - Day 3 homework

### What I did

This assignment is another PSD to HTML practice. 

I was given a png image, depicting a "screenshot" of a site similar in structure to Hacker News. I then created both the HTML and the CSS, using Chrome's developer tools to aid in creating a pixel perfect conversion.

The original assignment is below.




## HTML/CSS/Git Intro - Iron News

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... *minimalist* design ethic.

Since it's so simple (there's only one image!) we're going to start off here.

At the same time, we're also going to get into the habit of frequently creating git commits as checkpoints.

### Normal Mode

Using HTML and CSS, re-create the included image (`Iron News.png`) as a webpage. Don't worry about the text content (feel free to use an ipsum generator), but use the original image and *make your best effort* to match the dimensions and styles of original page to yours.
